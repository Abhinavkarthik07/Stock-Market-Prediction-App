ðŸ“ˆ Stock Market Prediction App

The project aims to build a web-based application that predicts the future stock prices of a selected company using historical stock data and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) deep learning models.

It allows users to:

Input a stock ticker (e.g., AAPL, TSLA, INFY.NS)
Fetch the company's past stock data
Train an LSTM model on that data
Forecast the next 30 days of closing prices
Visualize and download the predictions

Tech Stack
